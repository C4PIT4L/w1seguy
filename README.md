my way of solving this CTF :) 
--------------------------------------------

At first I tried to be sophisticated and go in different ways in order to hack and gain access to the server, it didn't work :(

After that, after looking at the attached source code, I decided to go head-to-head and build a reverse program that would try to brute force the key

I ran the program and after a while... I got the first FlagðŸ¥³

I wrote down the key in its designated place and got the second flag
