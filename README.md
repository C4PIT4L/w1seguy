Scripts and my way of solving this CTF :) 
--------------------------------------------

At first I tried to be sophisticated and go in different ways in order to hack and gain access to the server, it didn't work :(

After that, after looking at the attached source code, I decided to go head-to-head and build a reverse program that would try to brute force the key

After a while the program ran, I got an almost correct answer

I had a feeling that my key was correct except for the last letter, so I decided to change the script to try everything possible instead of the last letter

I ran and... I got what I wantedðŸ¥³
